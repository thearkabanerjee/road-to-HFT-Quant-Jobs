# Risk:

1. Inventory Risk (Price Movement Risk)

The biggest risk: a market maker might buy an asset expecting to quickly sell it, but the price could move against them before they offload.
Example: If they buy a stock at ₹100 (from a seller) and before they can sell it at ₹101 the price drops to ₹95, they’re stuck holding a losing position.

2. Adverse Selection Risk

This happens when the market maker trades against someone with better information.
Example: A market maker quotes ₹100.20 to sell a stock. If a large trader with insider knowledge buys at that price just before big positive news is released, the market maker will suffer losses as the stock rockets upward.

Basically, market makers can get “picked off” by informed traders.

3. Liquidity Risk

In volatile times (say, during a financial crisis or crypto crash), buyers and sellers may disappear.
Market makers are obliged to keep providing quotes, but if no one is trading on the other side, they’re forced to hold large risky positions.

4. Execution & Latency Risk (Tech Risk)

Modern market making is algorithmic. If their systems are slower than competitors, they’ll consistently lose to faster firms.
Glitches or delays can cause huge, sudden losses (e.g., Knight Capital’s 2012 collapse—lost $440M in 45 minutes due to a trading software bug).

5. Regulatory & Compliance Risk

Exchanges and regulators impose obligations on market makers (like minimum quote sizes, maximum spreads).
If they fail to meet obligations during volatile times, they risk penalties or losing their license.

6. Funding & Margin Risk

Market makers often use leverage to scale operations. Sharp moves can trigger margin calls, forcing them to liquidate at a loss.
